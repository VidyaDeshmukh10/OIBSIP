# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project was completed as part of the Data Analytics Internship at Oasis Infobyte (OIBSIP).

# Objective
The objective of this project is to segment customers based on their income and spending behavior using unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering).

# Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographic details, income, purchasing behavior, and spending patterns.

# Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature selection  
- Standardization of data  
- K-Means clustering  
- Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters  
- Visualization of customer segments  

# Results
Customers were segmented into 4 distinct clusters representing different income and spending patterns.  
These insights can help businesses design targeted marketing strategies.
