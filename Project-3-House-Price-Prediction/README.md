# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using Linear Regression.  
It was completed as Task 3 of my Data Analytics Internship at Oasis Infobyte.

# Objective
To build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on important property features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and parking.

# Dataset
The dataset contains numerical features related to house properties, including:
- Area
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Stories
- Parking
- Price (target variable)

# Methodology
1. Data collection and loading  
2. Data exploration and cleaning  
3. Feature selection  
4. Model training using Linear Regression  
5. Model evaluation using MSE and R² score  
6. Visualization of actual vs predicted prices  

# Results
The model shows a reasonable relationship between actual and predicted house prices, indicating that features like area and number of rooms significantly influence pricing.

# Visualization
- A scatter plot was created to compare actual house prices with predicted prices.
- This visualization helps evaluate the performance of the Linear Regression model.
- The closer the points are to the diagonal line, the better the prediction accuracy.

# Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab  

# Conclusion
This project helped strengthen my understanding of regression models, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques through hands-on implementation.
